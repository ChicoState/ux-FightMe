# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

This project was created to provide messengers an easy activity to launch and cultivate so that they don’t have to rely on just speaking to people or having an activity already in mind. As such, we focused on designing a game that is feasible for college students to be capable of making in 14 weeks. As well, we focused on the layout of the parts that aren’t the chat rooms–because standards for that layout are already well established–and how someone can still participate in the app even if they’re too low level to beat anyone else in a fight.

## Methods

The selected competitors for the competitive analysis are: Discord, which is primarily used for people who already have an activity chosen/purchased; SnapChat as it’s a messaging app that has a score that increases by talking to people; and Pokemon Go, because it’s a mobile video game predicated on going outside and meeting people to battle. The method of figuring out our competitors was picking the first applications that came to mind, with the exception of SnapChat. That was determined because that was how the software engineering team thought to describe the minimum viable product: SnapChat, but you use the SnapScore to fight people. We would then use Google to determine different aspects of the products we didn’t know on hand, like whether or not SnapChat could be run on Linux. Our method of determining demographics started with us ourselves being users or former users of the apps and estimating based on our experiences of other users. We then adjusted for other factors, like the game being a dedicated feature. 

## Findings

With competitive analysis, we found that our competitors are free, but do have premium services. Discord and SnapChat excel in being messaging apps–with discord being more geared towards intuitive design and large scale communication and SnapChat having a bigger focus on photo sharing and temporary conversations–while Pokemon Go excels at being a sociable game. However, Pokemon Go lacks a chat function and SnapChat doesn’t have much in the way of games or any usage of its SnapScore. Discord has the capacity for games, but it’s all third party that has to be manually set up and consented to or requires purchasing Discord’s premium service, Nitro. All in all, we determined that our demographic would be teenagers with a predisposition towards video games.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
