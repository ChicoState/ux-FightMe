# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Our project’s goal is to provide users with the ability to communicate with people through the common interest of the game provided with our application, FightMe. Picking up from the wireframes that we made during Phase Two, we are moving forward to refine and implement them into an interactable representation of how users would interact with our application’s features. This will be achieved through User Testing and the use of protocols to gather accurate data on our application’s functionality as well as to help access what features are to be changed/improved.

## Methods

There was a total of six (n=6) participants that were to assume the role of a user. The users would use our [prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/rpGDX4bsxX63vPUkJVCsLL/Wireframe?node-id=161-402&t=8bM6TptiKEkieRY6-1), which consisted of the core features that were revealed with the help of our wireframes such as being able to add friends and send messages. These features were then encapsulated within a functioning UI interface where the user is able to navigate through their messages, profile, or back to the homepage. This was done in order to simulate real world applications in order to ensure we get accurate information and feedback. Users interacted through this prototype in order to accomplish the tasks mentioned above where we then graded how the Prototype held up in performance. We had a [protocol](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18191653/Fight.Me.Usability.Test.Protocol-1.pdf) in place as to how we were to conduct the user tests. Firstly, tasks were fixed order as each one would require the previous ones completed to do in real life as well. Users were encouraged to think aloud about what actions they were taking and what assumptions they were making so that it was easier for us to note. We had to fight every instinct to help them as the tests were to see if they could do it on their own. We used a Think Aloud approach allowing us to follow along with the user to evaluate our prototype's performance compared to real world applications and get accurate feedback. The protocol is made up of three distinct sections:

### -Background Questions
<ins>**What messaging services do you use?**</ins>

This question was asked in order to analyze who our competitors are since messaging is one of the main functions of our application. It also served to give us insight into why these applications are so widely used.

<ins>**What are your favorite features of them?**</ins>

We asked this question in order to know what are some of the users favorite components for a specific messaging application as it will allow us to make improvements to our application if needed. For example, group chats were a common feature that many of our users mentioned.

<ins>**What things could be improved?**</ins>

With this question, we were able to gain valuable insight into what users were mostly unhappy with when using messaging applications and would serve as a guide for us in avoiding those problems. 

### -Tasks

**Task 1:** The user was tasked with finding a friend request that was sent to them–we specified that it was from a user going by LadiesMan217–, accepting it, then going through the battle for friendship. Realistically, the prototype should have only made the friendship happen when the user loses, but the point of this task was to see if they were capable of finding where the friend requests are and understand–without prompting–that friends requests are determined with a fight unlike other messaging apps. It was important to see how well this task was done, because every other functionality in the app depended on it and it was the only feature defined in the original project idea.

**Task 2:** The user had to initiate a fight with someone they were chatting with (BillyBobbyFerguson) and go through the game. The messaging aspect is a tried and true convention that every tester probably has experience with and it is a feature we could just not display correctly in this prototype, so it was more important that we determined if they could find the chatrooms and the app’s defining feature. Even though the user would have battled in the previous task, making it the focus of this one allowed us to see if they would understand how the game should be played and if they would click on documentation if they could not.

**Task 3:** The user had to train to increase their magic score, one out of three skills that can be trained and affect fights. As usual, it was a matter of finding the page, but while we were doing the pilot test, we determined that a video game controller D-pad might not be a good icon to represent the training page, so we switched it to a dumbbell. We needed to see if that natural mapping was a positive improvement.

**Task 4:** The user had to turn in a daily quest and a personal quest that they completed from doing all of the different fights. Considering this is what will maintain user engagement other than talking with friends and will be the main source of score for users, it’s important that this process goes as efficiently as possible.

**Task 5:** To test how our application fared in similarity to other messaging applications, users were tasked with purchasing a new profile picture through the shop and then apply their new choices in their profile’s settings. The effectiveness of the shop is extra important as there is the potential for real money to be spent here.

### -Debrief Questions
<ins>**What are some features you would like to see?**</ins>

This question was asked to assess what kind of features our application would benefit from and what it may have lacked due to some unmet user expectations. Users may have expected a certain button or page to be available somewhere that was not met and through this question we were able to identify it.

<ins>**Are there any elements of the app that you did not like or found difficult to use?**</ins>

Here we were able to find components that needed the most attention as they brought out dissatisfaction to the user experience.

<ins>**What do you like most about the app?**</ins>

Through this question it was made evident what made the users have the greatest experience and allowed us to understand what kind of features or concepts our application excelled in. Therefore, it is priceless information as it will allow us to augment what our application excels in.

<ins>**Is the layout easy to navigate and follow? What changes could be made?**</ins>

Here we were able to know whether or not the users had an easy time navigating through our application, and fortunately most answered that they did. As a result, we discovered that we could focus on other aspects of the application to improve rather than our layout and ease of navigation. 

Finally, and fittingly, our Protocol was summative--only evaluating once we have all the tasks completed--in order to apply everything that is to be gathered from our findings to finalize our application through real world users and get more accurate results and feedback on our interactions. 

## Findings

Our [study](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kyxI-5p-LNKBUgJsgIkZA_qxixEknfDYoLHLr7W_66s/edit?usp=sharing) suggests that our application does follow the standard principles of a messaging application, allowing the user to use their cognitive mapping to find where most of the application’s features are located in order to accomplish their tasks. Our application is able to meet expectations as a messaging application making it easy for users to carry out their expectations and have their needs fulfilled by our application such as messaging and interacting with other users. There are however some caveats such as with our innate feature, “FightMe”,  not being clearly expressed by our application. Features that were not clearly illustrated/designed to be appealing to users were often overlooked and in the case of “FightMe” appeared as unnecessary due there being a lack of clearness on what effect it would have on our application. Some of the users found it weird that completed quests were closed with a red X rather than just pressing the quest itself. The Quantitative data gave us a good view on what was the overall average success rate for the tasks that were given to our users. On average users were able to navigate through our prototype’s interface as well as be able to interact within our environment comfortably enough without us having to do any rapid changes due to functions not behaving up to performance.

## Conclusions

Our findings show that our application meets user expectations for a messaging platform, since users found the layout and navigation conventional and easy to use. However the “Fight Me” button, or feature, needs clearer instructions and better integration, as many users found it confusing and unintuitive to use. To improve this user experience, we could add a tutorial, add tooltips for this feature and make it more evident that the “Fight Me” feature is a button in a way that is distinct from the rest of the messaging platform, or make the feature explicitly outlined in advertisements. Features like friend requests and profile customization were well-received, but the friend requests feature could benefit from having another button located in the profile page. The FightMe battle page was also intuitive and well-received for users so it should remain unchanged as users had an overall great experience with it. Overall, the application succeeds in its core functionality, but refining unique features and addressing some of the prototype limitations will make for an even greater user experience. The red X of quests could get removed.

## Caveats

There were several limitations in the features that we were able to implement due to the use of Figma. Features such as text fields, sending videos/pictures as well as any form of animations that were not for transitions were not advised by figma. To illustrate the complexities with one feature, the only conceivable way to implement the text field was to manually create a handle case for every key on the board to append to a local string or replace the default text. This resulted in some less than ideal performance during the user testing phase when having to study how our prototype’s features functioned. This also means that we were unable to represent the dungeon video game that the software engineering team was actually able to implement in any meaningful way. As for limitations regarding our testing population, everyone was a college student (presumably) over the age of twenty. While that aligns with our target demographic, these were also technology and engineering majors, who are highly likely to be more versed in applications than the average college student, who are in turn much more technologically proficient than other age groups. The success rate of tasks could be much lower in a natural scenario. We also assumed that everyone was well aware of how messaging applications work, which could have definitely been proven wrong.
