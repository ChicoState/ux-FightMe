# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Our project’s goal is to provide users with the ability to communicate with people through the common interest of the game provided with our application, FightMe. Picking up from the wireframes that we made during Phase Two, we are moving forward to refine and implement them into an interactable representation of how users would interact with our application’s features. This will be achieved through User Testing and the use of protocols to gather accurate data on our application’s functionality as well as to help access what features are to be changed/improved.

## Methods

There was a total of six (n=6) participants that were to assume the role of a user. We had a [protocol](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18191653/Fight.Me.Usability.Test.Protocol-1.pdf) in place as to how we were to conduct the user tests. Firstly, tasks were fixed order as each one would require the previous ones completed to do in real life as well. Users were encouraged to think aloud about what actions they were taking and what assumptions they were making so that it was easier for us to note. The protocol is made up of three distinct sections:

### Background Questions

### Tasks

### Debrief Questions

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

There were several limitations in the features that we were able to implement due to the use of Figma. Features such as text fields, sending videos/pictures as well as any form of animations that were not for transitions were not advised by figma. To illustrate the complexities with one feature, the only conceivable way to implement the text field was to manually create a handle case for every key on the board to append to a local string or replace the default text. This resulted in some less than ideal performance during the user testing phase when having to study how our prototype’s features functioned. This also means that we were unable to represent the dungeon video game that the software engineering team was actually able to implement in any meaningful way. As for limitations regarding our testing population, everyone was a college student (presumably) over the age of twenty. While that aligns with our target demographic, these were also technology and engineering majors, who are highly likely to be more versed in applications than the average college student, who are in turn much more technologically proficient than other age groups. The success rate of tasks could be much lower in a natural scenario. We also assumed that everyone was well aware of how messaging applications work, which could have definitely been proven wrong.
