# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

2 external evaluators (n=2) conducted cognitive walkthroughs using the wireframes we created. Pretending that they were one of the personas we created in phase I, the evaluators navigated the wireframes in order to accomplish the task outlined by the persona's accompanying scenario. The first picked Trevor Galloway as the persona and Trevor Relaxes With Electronic Chores as the scenario while other picked the Joe Dane persona with the Ice Breaker With Doe Scenario. The first evaluator documented their walkthrough in [Congestive Walkthrough.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17593475/Congestive.Walkthrough.pdf) while the other documented theirs in [Cognitive Walkthrough-1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17593479/Cognitive.Walkthrough-1.pdf). 

In order to receive informal feedback, the software engineering team asked questions to an audience of 65 people (n=5) during a demonstration of the product.
The questions that we provided were:
* Would you (The User) prefer to train one core player stat, or multiple?
* Would you (The User) like to be able to create a "Chat group" and compete against other groups?
* Would you prefer idle games, forums that contribute to stats, or both?
* Should we include profile pictures, or should users be solely represented by their avatar?
* What is an acceptable amount of gambling/gacha features?

The notes of the feedback were documented in the [Fight me demo feedback.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17593607/Fight.me.demo.feedback.pdf).


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
