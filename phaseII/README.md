# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Fight Me was created with the main objective of allowing our users the ability to make new friends, and jump right into riveting and engaging gameplay all the while maintaining a form of communication through our application. Our previous sprint left us with a rich amount of information, how easy our interface is to navigate, which features were important, and which features to prioritize. The focus for this sprint is to be able to use user feedback to help further develop the applicationâ€™s features compared to our first sprint where we created just the interface.

## Methods

### Cognitive Walkthrough
2 external evaluators (n=2) conducted cognitive walkthroughs using the wireframes we created. Pretending that they were one of the personas we created in phase I, the evaluators navigated the wireframes in order to accomplish the task outlined by the persona's accompanying scenario. The first picked Trevor Galloway as the persona and Trevor Relaxes With Electronic Chores as the scenario while other picked the Joe Dane persona with the Ice Breaker With Doe Scenario. The first evaluator documented their walkthrough in [Congestive Walkthrough](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17593475/Congestive.Walkthrough.pdf) while the other documented theirs in [Cognitive Walkthrough](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17593479/Cognitive.Walkthrough-1.pdf). 

### Informal Feedback
In order to receive informal feedback, the software engineering team asked questions to an audience of 65 people (n=5) during a demonstration of the product.
The questions that we provided were:
* Would you (The User) prefer to train one core player stat, or multiple?
* Would you (The User) like to be able to create a "Chat group" and compete against other groups?
* Would you prefer idle games, forums that contribute to stats, or both?
* Should we include profile pictures, or should users be solely represented by their avatar?
* What is an acceptable amount of gambling/gacha features?

The notes of the feedback were documented in [Fight me demo feedback](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17593607/Fight.me.demo.feedback.pdf).


## Findings

### Cognitive Walkthrough
The Trevor evaluator was able to navigate from the home screen to the chats page to a chat room to the outcome of a fight without too much trouble. However, he struggled to figure out how to enter the battle, which means that the fight button at the top of the chat page is not discernable enough from a title widget. The fact that he thought that he could access the chats page through the VS button means that it can be used to keep track of chats that currently have a fight going on. This can help later on, because we are still not sure how the dashboard should truly be set up and what the fourth page in the navigation bar should be. The Doe evaluator similarly struggled with the navigation bar being unlabeled. He makes note that while the button to a chat room isn't labeled, there is enough of a standard with chatboxes that most people will understand clicking on the chatbox sends them to the chat room. However, he states the layout of the text field and the arrow at the bottom of the chat room are well placed enough to require no labeling. While he correctly surmises that the fight button is the way to access a fight, he does comment that it is potentially confusing. Once he is finished with a battle, he correctly chooses "Ok" to close the window, but he does not see a way to leave the chat room. This is simply a matter of us forgetting to include the back button when we transferred the wireframes to one page.

### Informal Feedback
The first and second questions revealed that user would want multiple trainable scores and group chat functionality. The third question revealed that the games that are incorporated should be active rather than idle, because the focus of the entire application is maintaining conversations and connections. The last question showed that there is a potential to incorporate a shop or gambling features with avatars as the products.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
