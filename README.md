# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis showed there is a niche of a messaging app and game combination that can be filled:
  * Discord: Excels in intuitive and large scale communication, but game integration is clunky and unsupported.
  * SnapChat: Excels in picture focused and temporary conversations, but user score is irrelevant.
  * Pokemon Go: Excels in being a social game, but lacks a chat feature.
* Heuristic evaluation put more focus on Discord, showing that it:
  * has strengths:
    * A wide array of customization.
    * Provides a lot of support for new users on desktop.
  * but also weaknesses:
    * Most of the customization is locked behind a paywall.
    * New users have less support on mobile.
    * No safety nets for removing or blocking a friend.
* Personas and scenarios allowed for a higher fidelity visualization of the users and their needs:
  * Ages can range from high school to just entered the workforce.
  * To be able to socialize even if they can't converse.
  * A casual character leveling experience.
* Sketches and diagrams showed that our app could:
  * Arrange its components to smoothly flow into each other.
  * Comfortably faciliate interactions.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* Wireframes provided high fidelity visualization of the expected look of the application to facilitate more precise evaluation.
* Two outside evaluators conducted cognitive walkthroughs with the aforementioned wireframes and the previous phase's personas and scenarios to determine that while there were a few hiccups in navigation--i.e. a page missing a back arrow, navigation bar widgets not being labeled, and the "fight me" button to enter the fight stage not being distinct enough to make out from a title--the general layout of the application conforms with standards of messaging applications and should be easy to navigate.
* During a demonstration, the software engineering team asked a crowd of 65 observers UX provided questions to get the following informal feedback:
  * Users wish for multiple trainable scores and group chats.
  * Incorporated games should be active, not idle.
  * There is a potential for monetization through profile customization.
